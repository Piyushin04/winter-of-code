    <h3 className='text-xl font-semibold mb-2'>Organizations</h3>
    <p>
        Organizations serve as the beating heart of our vibrant open-source community. They are the driving force behind the Winter of Code, playing a pivotal role in curating a dynamic environment where innovation thrives. These organizations actively engage in the selection process, identifying and welcoming both potential students and mentors who are passionate about contributing to diverse projects.
    </p>
    <p>
        Within the framework of the Winter of Code, organizations provide a robust platform for collaboration. This collaborative space is where students and mentors come together to embark on a journey of exploration, development, and knowledge-sharing. By fostering a culture of inclusivity and continuous learning, these organizations empower students to make meaningful contributions, learn new skills, and grow both personally and professionally within the realm of open source.
    </p>
    <p>
        The role of organizations extends beyond project curation; they act as catalysts for learning and growth. Through mentorship, guidance, and a supportive community, organizations create an environment where students can not only contribute to ongoing projects but also gain valuable insights into the world of open source. This intersection of collaboration and education ensures that the Winter of Code becomes a transformative experience for all involved, fostering a sense of belonging and accomplishment.

    <h3 className='text-xl font-semibold mb-2'>Mentors</h3>
    <p>
        Mentors play an indispensable role as guiding lights for students navigating the exciting journey of the Winter of Code. With a deep commitment to nurturing talent, mentors actively engage with students throughout the winter, offering unwavering support, valuable insights, and expert guidance. Their role extends beyond mere assistance; mentors serve as pillars of strength, helping students overcome challenges, gain clarity, and maximize their potential.
    </p>
    <p>
        Throughout the Winter of Code, mentors become trusted companions, sharing their wealth of experience and expertise. They create a collaborative space where questions are welcomed, challenges are transformed into learning opportunities, and each student's journey is personalized for optimal growth. Mentors act as catalysts for skill development, fostering an environment where students not only contribute meaningfully to projects but also acquire a diverse set of skills that extend beyond the technical realm.
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition to their supportive role, mentors hold a key position in the evaluation process. They provide constructive feedback, assess project milestones, and contribute to shaping the overall progress of each student. This dual responsibility of guidance and evaluation ensures that the Winter of Code is not just a coding challenge but a holistic learning experience under the mentorship of seasoned professionals. The dedication of mentors is instrumental in creating a collaborative, enriching, and empowering learning environment for all participants.

    <h3 className='text-xl font-semibold mb-2'>Students</h3>
    <p>
        Students stand as the dynamic driving force propelling the Winter of Code forward. Their journey commences with the enthusiastic act of filling in the registration form, where they not only express their interest but also showcase their diverse skills. This initial step is a testament to their eagerness to embark on a transformative learning experience within the open-source community.
    </p>
    <p>
        Following a thorough internal screening process, students are presented with the opportunity to take a deeper dive into the world of open-source collaboration. Armed with their unique strengths and aspirations, they have the chance to submit project proposals. These proposals serve as a canvas for students to articulate their vision, demonstrating a genuine willingness to contribute to any of the participating organizations.
    </p>
    <p>
        This pivotal phase aligns students' passions with impactful projects, setting the stage for a winter filled with coding challenges and continuous learning. The submission of project proposals not only marks a commitment to contribute meaningfully but also opens doors to a realm of possibilities where students can apply their skills, explore new horizons, and make a tangible impact in the world of open source.
    </p>
    <p>
        In essence, students are not just participants; they are architects of their own learning journey during the Winter of Code, contributing their unique perspectives and skills to shape the future of open-source development.
